### CueTrigger for Shelly

Script that integrates [Shelly devices](https://www.shelly.com/) with a switch or pushbutton to wirelessly trigger or stop cues on CueServer from [Interactive Technologies](https://interactive-online.com/).

Switch mode will send the command `Cue Start`/`Cue Stop`, pushbutton mode will send the command `Cue Start`. 

While Shelly products are typically designed for IoT applications, they can also offer a cost-effective control solution for professional use.  
However the reliability of 2,4 GHz Wi-Fi in certain environments should be carefully considered.

This wireless solution serves as a simple alternative in situations where running signal cables to a switch or push button is impractical.
The setup is straightforward and offers an affordable option, with the only cost being the purchase of a compatible Shelly device.

Supported devices from Shelly include the Gen2+ devices with input instances. Some examples are the Shelly Plus I4, Shelly Plus 1 (Mini), Shelly Plus 1 PM (Mini), Shelly Plus 2 PM, Shelly Plus Uni, Shelly Pro 1, Shelly Pro 1 PM, Shelly Pro 2, Shelly Pro 2 PM, Shelly Pro 3, Shelly Pro 4 PM and Shelly Pro Dual Cover PM. However the number of inputs depends on the model.


For testing purposes, a Shelly Plus i4 DC is used, allowing it to trigger four different cues in combination with the online CueServer 2 farm.
