### CueTrigger for Shelly

gobo.ws has developed an open-source script that integrates [Shelly devices](https://www.shelly.com/) with any switch or pushbutton to wirelessly trigger or stop cues on CueCore3, CueCore2, QuadCore, or Cuety LPU-2 devices from [Visual Productions](https://www.visualproductions.nl/).

While Shelly products are typically designed for IoT applications, they can also offer a cost-effective lighting control solution for professional use. For instance Rigport incorporates Shellies into their SmartVT range. However the reliability of 2,4 GHz Wi-Fi in certain environments should be carefully considered.

This wireless solution serves as a simple alternative to the CueCore's GPI ports or B-Station, particularly in situations where running signal cables to a switch or push button is impractical.
The setup is straightforward and offers an affordable option, with the only cost being the purchase of a compatible Shelly device.

For testing purposes, a Shelly Plus i4 DC is used, allowing it to trigger four different cues in combination with the online CueCore3 demo unit.
